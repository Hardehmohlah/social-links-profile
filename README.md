## Overview
I remodelled this project to actually use it as a personal social links profile

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [(https://vercel.live/link/social-links-profile-black-phi.vercel.app?via=project-dashboard-alias-list&p=1)]

## My process
I first built the html page, the links and all, then i styled it.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
Building this project has helped me to touch up on my css skille like hover effect even adding a timer.

### Continued development

Extra cool hover effects
